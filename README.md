# Cloth-of-Gold
By Adam Murray and Sean Murray

## Description:
This is my game project "Cloth of Gold" using Unity and written in C#. Named after the "cloth of gold" snail whos shell pigment pattern resembles the output of Stephen Wolframs "Rule 30" cellular automata. The premiss of the game is essentially a two-player checkers-like stratagy game in which the goal is to out-survive or destroy your opponent. The core mechanics of the game utilize various cellular automata algorithms (i.e. Conway's Game of Life and Termites), various noise algorithms (i.e. Perlin Noise and Open Simplex Noise), and custom AI search alogirthms.

## Current Status:
- Scraping current version for useful code.
- Starting new version in Unity.
- Working on settting up 3-dimensional array system for holding the info for the ground tile, the enviornmental prop, the tile status effect (i.e. fire), and the player unit.
- Working on getCellStatus() to return values from Z column in array.
- Working on setCellAlive() to set if the cell has a unit on it or not.
